# Localizing help files

Helpinator allows you to create multi-lingual help projects. You can store all languages in one project file, preserving project structure and topic context IDs across all supported languages. Thus you don't need to manage separate help projects for all UI languages supported.


Helpinator localization capabilities stand on three whales:



1. [Multiple languages](multiplelanguages.md "Multiple languages")  in one project file
2. [Language strings](languagestrings.md "Language strings")  that allow to translate templates
3. [XML Import/Export](xmlimportexport0.md "XML Import/Export")  that allows to communicate with translation services and software.
