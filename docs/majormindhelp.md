MajorMindHelp is our experimental help system for Delphi applications. For example, Helpinator itself uses MajorMindHelp (click F1 to see it).




Main features:


1. HTML-based, full-featured help system.


2. Compiles right into Delphi application, no standalone files or help systems required


3. No problems with CHM help files security


4. No problems with WebHelp cross-browser compatibility and security settings.


5. Multilingual. All languages are in one help file and they can be easily switched between.


6. Transparent help file format - just a zip file with HTML and XML in it.




Helpinator compiles MajorMindHelp directly, without any other tools.




Compiled Help looks like this:
