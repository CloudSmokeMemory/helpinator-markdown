## Quickly update screenshots when UI changes

Helpinator has three main features that help you to update screenshots quickly:



1. [Image Library](managingimages "Image Library") . When you store all screenshots in the image library you don't need to browse through all topics to find screenshots that you need to alter.
2. [Screeshot REcapture](screenshots "Screeshot REcapture") . This feature allows you to REcapture screenshots that are stored in the image library. Image name remains the same as well as added callouts/annotations.
3. ["Cloned" Images](clonedimages ""Cloned" Images") . Clones share the same image with "donor" but each has it's own callouts/annotations. When UI changes you only need to update "donor" images and Helpinator updates clones automatically.
