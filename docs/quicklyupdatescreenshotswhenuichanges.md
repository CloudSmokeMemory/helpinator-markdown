Helpinator has three main features that help you to update screenshots quickly:




. Clones share the same image with "donor" but each has it's own callouts/annotations. When UI changes you only need to update "donor" images and Helpinator updates clones automatically.



[Image Library](managingimages.md "Image Library") . When you store all screenshots in the image library you don't need to browse through all topics to find screenshots that you need to alter.
[Screeshot REcapture](screenshots.md "Screeshot REcapture") . This feature allows you to REcapture screenshots that are stored in the image library. Image name remains the same as well as added callouts/annotations.
["Cloned" Images](clonedimages.md ""Cloned" Images")
