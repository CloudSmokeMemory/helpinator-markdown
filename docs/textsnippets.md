# Text Snippets

Text snippets are named reusable blocks of formatted text that you can create once and use in many topics. They are especially useful in creating/managing different kinds of sidebars in your topics.


The picture below shows how to manage text snippets.

There are two types of text snippets:


1. Simple pieces of formatted text
2. Parameterized snippets, that contain special placeholder TEXTFORSNIPPET which Helpinator replaces with text from the topic.


Here's an example of the second type text snippet:
